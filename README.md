We now have a base for our space shooter. It's pretty hard coming into the middle of this code and figuring out what to do, but it seems you can find most answers to your problems online in some shape or form (Thank god for the MIT licenses). I had code for the game over screen but it was giving syntax errors so I decided to scrap it.
